Most things I'm comfortable with strangers knowing about me is in the
<a href="/about.html">about</a> page. The different projects that I manage or
contribute to are on the <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> page.

<p>
I also write about programming.
(And a bit about math, but those are the same anyway, right?)
