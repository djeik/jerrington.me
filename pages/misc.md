# Remarks

Random thoughts that pass through my head.

  * "The [Haskell] typechecker invites 'failure-driven development.'"
    [source](http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2017-05-03-what-a-haskell-study-group-is-not.html)

  * The words "triangle" and "quadrilateral" really bother me.
    It's "pentagon", "hexagon", "heptagon" and so forth beyond 4 sides.
    A quadrilateral ought to be called a tetragon, and a triangle ought to be
    called a trigon.

  * _The Paradox of the Real Line™_

    Despite being a complete ordered field, satisfying a lot of algebraic and
    relational properties and hence being very structured from a
    model-theoretic point of view, the real line *feels* very unstructured and
    ad hoc.

  * Many activists in my experience believe something to the effect that
    certain ideologies should not be allowed to have a platform.
    In other words, it should be illegal to speak about certain things.
    I disapprove of doing so, at least in such a broad manner, but I won't go
    into the reasons why, at least not beyond the following remark.

    What's interesting about this idea is this:
    suppose that certain speech could simply be banned.
    You say something wrong? We lock you up and throw away the key.
    Now we need a body to oversee what speech is and is not allowed.
    It surprises me that the very same activists who advocate for the
    prohibition of certain speech generally seem to operate under the
    assumption that *they* would form that body.
    This assumption is dangerous and unfounded.
    Who's to stop such a body from deciding that the advocacy for GLBT rights
    is banned, and consequently locking up many of the same activists who
    sought to install the body?

    Hence, when someone says "we should be allowed to ban certain types of
    speech", they don't really mean "we" in the general social sense of the
    word whereby some government body is in charge of such an affair.
    They mean "*I* should be allowed to ban certain types of speech."

    To be honest, I would have no problem with activists saying precisely that.
    What I do have a problem with is making it sound like there's some kind of
    nice general way of deciding whether one type of speech or another is
    problematic and should be banned.
    There isn't, at least not of the form that would please the majority of
    those activists, in my opinion.
    There will be arbitrariness in the decision-making process.
    It should be made clear by those same activists just how arbitrarily they
    would decide these things.

    I believe that discrimination is unjustifiable *provided that* it be on the
    grounds of the uncontrollable circumstances of one's birth.
    For some things this is clear, e.g. skin colour.
    For other things, it has been up until somewhat recently less clear, e.g.
    sexual orientation.
    This decision should be grounded scientifically to the fullest extent
    possible.

    Strangely enough, the Criminal Code of Canada protects religion in this
    regard - discrimation on the grounds of religion is illegal - yet religion
    is fundamentally a *choice*.
    You don't see isolated island populations suddenly developing Christianity.
    (You probably will see them having homosexual relationships though!)
    So although such populations might develop the notion of religion, the
    particular flavour of it that they invent is up to their personal decisions
    and culture.
    And if I think that their beliefs are wrong - maybe they believe in an
    invisible pink unicorn - then I should be allowed not to hire them for the
    position I'm trying to fill.
