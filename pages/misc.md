# Professor quotes

## Prakash Panangaden

A few days after handing out the first assignment:

> Today is Janice Joplin's birthday. If you're struggling with the assignment,
> I suggest you go on YouTube and look up one of her songs, _Try Just a Little
> Bit Harder_.

In the context of the decidability of the emptiness problem for
$\omega$-regular languages:

> If you find yourself in a finite maze and someone asks you to go for an
> infinite walk, then you're bound to find yourself in the same room more than
> once at some point.

Before giving a somewhat technical proof that generalized Büchi automata are
equivalent to ordinary Büchi automata:

> True understanding comes from Greek letters!

After noticing an error in the proof:

> True understanding doesn't come from Greek letters after all!
