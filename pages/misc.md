# Remarks

Random thoughts that pass through my head.

  * Individual subreddits appear to develop their own personalized linguistic
    features. For example, `/r/raisedbynarcissists` refers to disliked family
    members by prefixing their title with a capital N. People talk about
    Nmothers and Nfathers and Nbrothers and Nsisters.
    I wonder what *types* of subreddits develop special language.
    Clearly, not all subreddits do. The very general ones like
    `/r/showerthoughts` don't have any subreddit-specific language.
    Subreddits like `/r/haskell` feature technical language, but this language
    isn't *specific to that subreddit*. It's merely specific to the thing that
    the subreddit is being discussed.
    Of course, I might just be ignorant; perhaps the N prefixing done in
    `/r/raisedbynarcissists` is actually common among people with bad parents.

  * "The [Haskell] typechecker invites 'failure-driven development.'"
    [source](http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2017-05-03-what-a-haskell-study-group-is-not.html)

  * The words "triangle" and "quadrilateral" really bother me.
    It's "pentagon", "hexagon", "heptagon" and so forth beyond 4 sides.
    A quadrilateral ought to be called a tetragon, and a triangle ought to be
    called a trigon.

  * _The Paradox of the Real Line™_

    Despite being a complete ordered field, satisfying a lot of algebraic and
    relational properties and hence being very structured from a
    model-theoretic point of view, the real line *feels* very unstructured and
    ad hoc.

  * Many activists in my experience believe something to the effect that
    certain ideologies should not be allowed to have a platform.
    In other words, it should be illegal to speak about certain things.
    I disapprove of doing so, at least in such a broad manner, but I won't go
    into the reasons why, at least not beyond the following remark.

    What's interesting about this idea is this:
    suppose that certain speech could simply be banned.
    You say something wrong? We lock you up and throw away the key.
    Now we need a body to oversee what speech is and is not allowed.
    It surprises me that the very same activists who advocate for the
    prohibition of certain speech generally seem to operate under the
    assumption that *they* would form that body.
    This assumption is dangerous and unfounded.
    Who's to stop such a body from deciding that the advocacy for GLBT rights
    is banned, and consequently locking up many of the same activists who
    sought to install the body?

    Hence, when someone says "we should be allowed to ban certain types of
    speech", they don't really mean "we" in the general social sense of the
    word whereby some government body is in charge of such an affair.
    They mean "*I* should be allowed to ban certain types of speech."

    To be honest, I would have no problem with activists saying precisely that.
    What I do have a problem with is making it sound like there's some kind of
    nice general way of deciding whether one type of speech or another is
    problematic and should be banned.
    There isn't, at least not of the form that would please the majority of
    those activists, in my opinion.
    There will be arbitrariness in the decision-making process.
    It should be made clear by those same activists just how arbitrarily they
    would decide these things.

    I believe that discrimination is unjustifiable *provided that* it be on the
    grounds of the uncontrollable circumstances of one's birth.
    For some things this is clear, e.g. skin colour.
    For other things, it has been up until somewhat recently less clear, e.g.
    sexual orientation.
    This decision should be grounded scientifically to the fullest extent
    possible.

    Strangely enough, the Criminal Code of Canada protects religion in this
    regard - discrimation on the grounds of religion is illegal - yet religion
    is fundamentally a *choice*.
    You don't see isolated island populations suddenly developing Christianity.
    (You probably will see them having homosexual relationships though!)
    So although such populations might develop the notion of religion, the
    particular flavour of it that they invent is up to their personal decisions
    and culture.
    And if I think that their beliefs are wrong - maybe they believe in an
    invisible pink unicorn - then I should be allowed not to hire them for the
    position I'm trying to fill.

## Miscellaneous

From a Vice article advocating ditching the smartphone in favour of a flip
phone:

> And that's how I learned the thin line between having good morals and having
> bad credit.

More generally, this reminds me of something that I like to believe.

> Ten percent of people are fundamentally bad, and will always do evil.
> Ten percent of people are fundamentally good, and will always do good.
> For the remaining eighty percent, it depends.

For those 80% without any particular strong convictions or moral compass, the
path of least resistance is the way to go. The analysis weighs how easy it is
to do something versus how great the desire is to do it. In other terms, it
weighs the payoff against the odds of getting caught.

My friend Kevin and I were discussing the other day our personal policies for
leaving things unattended in trains. Overall, I'm more lenient with this sort
of thing. I left my bag unattended on a train for maybe five entire hours. This
bag contained my computer and my passport among other things. The key thing
that made me comfortable with leaving it unattended is simply that the
valuables *are in a bag*. Just that is enough to deter the 80%. Nobody knows a
priori where exactly the passport is, or what exactly the contents of the
bag is, for that matter. Even if I had left my passport out in the open
entirely, I doubt it would be stolen. Most people are not identity thieves and
wouldn't know how to liquidate a passport. On the other hand, had I left my
*wallet* on my seat for five hours while I was reading in the cafe car, I'm
almost certain it would be gone or missing a few items. That's simply because
people know exactly what a wallet is for and how to use it: you pull out the
money or cards and you spend.

The conclusion I have is simple: people who _can_ do bad things with impunity
_will_ do bad things.
So when trying to decide whether someone is good or bad, it's no use to simply
check whether or not they did anything bad. We also have to look at whether it
was *possible* for them to do something bad.
